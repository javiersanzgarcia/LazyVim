# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

And added personal (and so lazy) config, special check over keymaps and plugins, this repository is a continuos WIP, how I try to optiomize how works LazyVim for me.

Except when I need to code in Java for some reason this "IDE" and the motions from it, is undeliable more efficient and satisfactory than any other thing

- WIP: GIthub Copilot would like to be excluded from CMP (as VSCode way)
